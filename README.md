This is a small game that I made in python. To use it, you need to have Python 3.7.9(IDLE) because that is what I used to make this game, and what I will develop it with.
*WARNING*, you will have to open the file INSIDE python, or it will bring up a black blank code screen. To do it, go into python3.7.9(IDLE), open a file, go to downloads, and get it from there.

About Version 0.0.2(logon):
This version adds a logon for accessing the nuke. The user is mired and the pass is jenky.

Thanks for playing my game! I will continue updating whenever I have the chance.This folder contains an Update log, I will update that too.
